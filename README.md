Efficient computation of isotropic N-point correlation function in Julia, implementing the algorithm of [Philcox & Slepian 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10278). This currently supports 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-point correlation functions in 2, 3 and 4 dimensional Cartesian geometries. 2-dimensional spherical geometries are also supported.
